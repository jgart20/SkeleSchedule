# SkeleSchedule
A scheduling app that portions out blocks of time into fun, digestible chunks. Designed by Jeremy Gart and available on the App Store soon!

# Overview

Within the documents uploaded, only one file was edited: ContentView.swift. This is the file that controls the front end of the app that is presented to the user, and as someone just getting into app creation, I did not feel like messing with the backend was a good idea. Within this file, I added text, changed its appearance and color, and added an image which I then resized as well.

Additionally, the jpg and the swift image were both added by me. The jpg needed to be uploaded by itself, then converted into a swift object in order for it to be implemented in the main ContentView document.

# Instructions
In order to run this program, one simply has to hit the "play" icon at the top of Swift and open it in an iPhone simulator, or view the preview in the Swift window.
